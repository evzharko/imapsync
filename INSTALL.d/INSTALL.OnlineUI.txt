==============================
= Installing imapsync online = 
==============================

Please consider this as relatively new and experimental.
I add I'm begining to be confident with /X since the /X service 
is up and running quite well since january 2017.

You have to be a little familiar with what is a CGI script
and how to activate it on an Apache (or any other) HTTP server.

The web visual user interface frontend is the file
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/imapsync_form.html
You can do a "view source" to see it as it is written,
and a "save" to get it locally.

This imapsync_form.html file in action calls the CGI location
/cgi-bin/imapsync
which has to be imapsync itself. 

The very latest and relatively stable imapsync is at
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/imapsync
It is the program file used verbatim for the service given at
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/

So copy both imapsync_form.html and imapsync on a HTTP server 
allowing CGIs and you'll have your own imapsync visual interface.


Example on a Debian server with Apache:

Imapsync place on the server disk:
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/imapsync

This classical /cgi-bin directory is configured in Apache
configuration file
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl
or
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default

It contains somewhere (maybe in comments for now, 
with some # characters to make them ignored):

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
<Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

The UI frontend file place on the server disk is
/var/www/X/imapsync_form.html
but it can be placed it anywhere on disk, the important
thing is that it has to be served by the web server. 

The imapsync working directory in cgi mode is
/var/tmp/imapsync_cgi/
it is not configurable unless changing it in
imapsync directly, it is hardcoded in imapsync. 
In this directory will go the log files and
the pid files.

Use at least CGI.pm release 4.08 (2014-10-18)
to avoid the bug "Undefined subroutine CGI::multi_param"
