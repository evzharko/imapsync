Dear imapsync user,

You're subscribed to the newsletter announcing imapsync new releases
(very few traffic) and the way to get them.
Send me a note if you don't want to receive those announces anymore.

You will find

 * imapsync.exe binary (release M4_imapsync_VERSION)
 * Mac OS X binary 
 * imapsync perl source code (release M4_imapsync_VERSION)

at the following link:

  https://imapsync.lamiral.info/dist/

Three important files are there:
* imapsync            is the perl script for a fast upgrade (also found in the tarball and zip).
* imapsync-M4_imapsync_VERSION.tgz  is the tarball containing the most part of the project (maybe too much)
* imapsync.M4_imapsync_VERSION.zip  is the win32 zip archive including standalone binary imapsync.exe

What's new in this M4_imapsync_VERSION release can be found at
https://imapsync.lamiral.info/S/news.shtml

I wish you successful imap transfers!

Feedback is welcome!
