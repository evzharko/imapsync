                Imapsync SSL errors
=====================================================

Questions anwswered in this FAQ are:

Q. What are the errors
  DEBUG: .../IO/Socket/SSL.pm:1165: local error: SSL write error
  or
  DEBUG: .../IO/Socket/SSL.pm:1088: local error: SSL read error


Q. What can I do to avoid those "SSL read/write errors"?

Q. What are the errors
  DEBUG: .../IO/Socket/SSL.pm:1165: local error: SSL write error
  or
  DEBUG: .../IO/Socket/SSL.pm:1088: local error: SSL read error

R. Like they claim, those errors are SSL errors. SSL is not directly
   done by imapsync but by an underlying Perl module called
   IO::Socket::SSL. Those errors arise sometimes and sometimes
   they form a serie that ends with imapsync auto-abortion.
   Those errors happen with some hosts but not with others,
   it's often Exchange or Office365. I don't know what exactly happens.
   Those errors happen more often on Windows than on Linux.

Q. What can I do to avoid those "SSL read/write errors"?

R1. Remove all ssl/tls encryption

  imapsync ...   --nossl1 --notls1 --nossl2 --notls2

R2. If you don't want to quit encryption, rerun imapsync until the 
    complete sync is over. Those errors are not at the same place 
    each time, so imapsync will sync remaining messages at each run
    until none remains.

R3. Run imapsync on a Linux machine, a VM is ok, there are less
    SSL errors on Unix.
    
R4. Use https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/
    It's a Linux host so R3 applies there.

R5. Set up a ssltunnel proxy to the host.
