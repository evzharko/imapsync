Q .Will I have any issues with browser timing out? What happens
   if the connection is closed for whatever reason?

R. It should be ok

With the /X interface there is two connections (three connections in
fact but let simplify the picture), 1 is the Browser-WebServer
connection, 2 is the WebServer-ImapServers connections (imapsync
stuff).

If the Browser-WebServer connection is timeout (but it shouldn't
because of the log refresh), the imapsync sync might continue
anyway. To see if it continues or not, just do a sync again and the
interface will tell you that a sync is already going on, if the
"Sync!" button is grey/inactive then just reload the page (F5 or
similar).

Anyway, on the /X you can try to do several parallel runs on the same
mailbox even if there is no timeout, open a new tab/windows with /X
and start a same sync, it's safe, the /X will say, if any, that there
is already a current sync.

You can stop this sync with the "Abort!" button from any /X
tab/window, even from another browser or place. To doing this with
success, you have to give the same account parameters, same
credentials, or imapsync will ignore the demand.
